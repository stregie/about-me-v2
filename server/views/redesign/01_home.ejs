            <h3>Aim for full-stack</h3>
            <p>Specialization is essential, but at this point I tried to strike a balance between learning frontend and backend development to be able to create a fully functional website. For this site, I used the following technologies:</p>
            <!-- <p>For a fully functional website, an intuitive and aesthetic interface is just as important as a sturdy app on server side, therefore I spent equal focus on both. For this site, I used the following technolgies, libraries and frameworks:</p> -->
            <!-- Possibilities: elegant UI, sturdy server side; client-side, server-side;  -->
            <p><b>Frontend:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, React<br>
            <b>Backend:</b> Node.js (Express), MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS S3</p>
            
            <h3>Self-educated, guided by a mentor</h3>
            <p>Review process, online courses (Coursera, Udemy), incorporating feedback, </p>

            <h3>Scientif mindset</h3>
            <p>
            
            <h3>From scratch</h3>
            <p>Even if a ready-to-use solution was available, I wrote the majority of the code myself to understand the fundamental concepts behind them. As I experienced, this approach also provided the ability to think outside the box while using frameworks.</p>
            <!-- Even though pre-built frameworks were available, I wrote the majority of the code myself to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts behind them. This approach allowed me to approach problems from a fresh perspective, leading to more innovative solutions. -->
