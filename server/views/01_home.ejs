              <h3>Aim for full-stack</h3>
              <p>Specialization is essential, but at this point I tried to strike a balance between learning frontend and backend development to be able to create a fully functional website. For this site, I used the following languages, technologies and concepts:</p>
              <p><b>Frontend:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5, jQuery, React, TypeScript<br>
              <b>Backend:</b> Node.js (Express), npm, REST APIs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS S3</p>
              <p>I also learned the basics of Vue.Js, Next.js, Sass, Tailwind CSS, Django (Python), although I haven't yet finished any projects with them suitable for showcase.</p>

              <h3>Scientific background</h3>
              <p>My experience in pharmaceutical industry and my educational background provides numerous transferable skills such as analytical thinking, attention to details, ability to break down complex problems into their simple elements, adaptability and continuous learning.</p>

              <h3>Solid fundamentals</h3>
              <p>Even if a ready-to-use solution was available, I wrote the majority of the code from scratch whenever I could to gain a deeper understanding of the underlaying concepts. As I experienced, this approach also provided the ability adopt new libraries and frameworks with ease.</p>

            <p>Each mini-site represents a different technology and follows my learning curve. Neither of them was created by following a step-by-step tutorial. And why the railway-theme? Well, it all started when I was looking for an image while learning the Node.js framework <i>Express</i>.</p>
