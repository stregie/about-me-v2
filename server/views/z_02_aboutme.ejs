              <h3>University</h3>
              <p>I graduated as a Chemical Engineer from the Technical University of Budapest specializing on Analytical Chemistry and Structure Elucidation. My main focus was gas and liquid chromatography which is used for identifying and determining the quantity of each compound in multi-component samples, even if the said component is present as one part per million.</p>
              <p>Apart from the chemistry-related knowledge I gained I am mostly grateful for the scientific mindset it gave and the practical approach to solve problems.</p>

              <h3>Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
              <p>Currently I work in a Research & Development laboratory at Egis Pharmaceuticals PLC. This laboratory uses solid-state analysis techniques such as X-ray Powder Diffraction, Thermal Analysis, Laser-Diffraction or Polarized Light Microscopy to determine and improve the properties of drugs.</p>
              <p>This requires good observation, precision, creativity and surprisingly, good communication skills to present your ideas on meetings, to keep contact with investors and foreign authorities or to resolve disagreements with a suppliers.</p>

              <h3>Learning web-development</h3>
              <p>I began studying by myself in 2021 from online courses, with the help of a friend who teaches web development by profession. My first focus was on the fundaments of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, followed by Node.js and then, React. After learning the ropes of each topic, I completed numerous examples and created small projects to gain a deeper knowledge, until I was able to combine them into well-integrated systems.</p>
              <p>Finding the time and motivation for learning after work hours required dedication and eventually led to a significant improvement in self-discipline, which I consider as the most valuable achievement during this period apart from the coding knowledge I gained.</p>

              <h3>Free time</h3>
              <p>Whenever I have to opportunity I try to get out into the nature - whether it is a hike in the nearby mountains, going somewhere further or just to sit by a lake with a friend, getting into discussions about the meaning of life. I also like travelling, and the number of places I have been to is still growing. Music is my other passion, I often visit live music events mostly from the underground scene.</p>
